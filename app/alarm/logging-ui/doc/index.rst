Alarms Logging
==============

Overview
--------

In order for the alarm system to be effective and functional, proper configuration and periodic tuning is essential.
While the Alarm Server monitors a set of PVs, tracking their alarm state, 
the alarm logging service archives all the state, configuration and commands associated with the Alarm Server.

The alarm logging table provides a user interface to the alarm logging service allowing users to effectively search, filter, and
parse through the archived messages to better configure the Alarm Server.
